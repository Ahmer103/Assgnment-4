            Mazar-e-Quaid (Urdu: مزارِ قائد), also known as Jinnah Mausoleum or
            the National Mausoleum, is the final resting place of Muhammad Ali
            Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Designed in a 1960s modernist
            style, it was completed in 1971, and is an iconic symbol of Karachi
            as well as one of the most popular tourist sites in the city.[1] The
            mausoleum complex also contains the tomb of Jinnah's sister, Māder-e
            Millat ("Mother of the Nation") Fatima Jinnah, as well as those of
            Liaquat Ali Khan and Nurul Amin, the first and eighth Prime
            Ministers of Pakistan respectively. The tomb of Sardar Abdur Rab
            Nishtar, a stalwart of the Muslim League from Peshawar, is also
            located there.
